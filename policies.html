                (1) identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income populations, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, 
                (2) develop a strategy for implementing environmental justice, and 
                (3) promote nondiscrimination in federal programs that affect human health and the environment, as well as provide minority and low-income communities access to public information and public participation."</div>

            <div class="text">The Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, says that CERCLA "provides a Federal "Superfund" to clean up uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous-waste sites as well as accidents, spills, and other emergency releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment. Through CERCLA, EPA was given power to seek out those parties responsible for any release and assure their cooperation in the cleanup." This is particularly important in handling environmental issues and also accreditting responsibility to corporations in the face of discriminatory pollution. </div>
