        <h2 class="what"> What is Environmental Justice? </h2>
        <p> Environmental justice is a movement that aims to achieve equality in the state of the environment for all people, especially working to ensure that groups of people are not disproporitionally and adversely affected by health hazards/risks caused by the environment. Various organizations and government agencies have began addressing the issue and bringing awareness to the cumulative environmental burdens that certain groups of people and regions have been faced with, and are attempting to enforce policies that repair and improve the situation. However, with discriminatory systems in place, there remains much work to be done. </p>
